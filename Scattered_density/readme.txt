The spiculated mass signal absent and signal present ROI dataset is uploaded as separate gzipped files due to filesize restrictions. The signal absent filenames end in *SA1/SA2.tar.gz and signal present with *SP1/SP2.tar.gz. 
ROI locations for signal present (mammo-scattered-SP.tar.gz) and signal absent (mammo-scattered-SA.tar.gz) are available.  Filenames include roi_SP/SA_PhantomSeed.loc. Signal present locations has three columns (X, Y, lesion number) where X,Y are pixel locations in the mammogram, and lesion 0-3 represent calc, 4-7 mass.  Corresponding signal present phantom voxel locations are available under repository VICTRE/Locations folder.  Signal absent locations has five columns (X_vox, Y_vox, Z_vox, X_pix, Y_pix) where first three are corresponding phantom location in voxels, last two are pixel location within the mammogram.
